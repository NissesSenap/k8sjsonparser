# k8sjsonparser

This is a repo that i will use to make a basic parser function of k8s files from a folder.
It's a way for me to learn how to write go-lang and nothing else.

I will probably focus on creating something easy like a service and not much else with a very limited functionaillity.

In the long run i plan to createa a cli to call on this application as well but for now a go run will have to do the trick.
